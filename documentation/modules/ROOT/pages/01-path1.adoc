The above step is the most important for this lab. The *OpenShift Cluster Wildcard DNS* should ideally look something like this.  `apps.cluster-pmjd8.pmjd8.sandbox783.opentlc.com` . 

*Warning:* The Cluster numbers for this lab are unique for each user so please do not copy and paste the above example. 

Please proceed to the next section to get started.
